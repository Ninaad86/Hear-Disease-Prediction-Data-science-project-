Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes multiple health indicators that help determine the presence of heart disease. A variety of classification models were trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model.

The key steps in this project include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset contains various health-related features such as:

Age
Gender
Chest pain type
Blood pressure
Cholesterol levels
Blood sugar levels
Resting ECG results
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise-induced angina
ST depression induced by exercise
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A detailed exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and detect outliers. Key findings from the EDA include:

Distribution of key features like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
Correlation heatmap to identify highly correlated features.
Analysis of missing data and outliers, and necessary data cleaning steps.

Conclusion
In this project, multiple machine learning models were evaluated to predict the likelihood of heart disease. XGBoost proved to be the most effective model, achieving the highest F1 score. Exploratory data analysis played a crucial role in understanding the dataset and improving model performance. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting heart disease risk, which could potentially help in early diagnosis and intervention.
